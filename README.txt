IMPORTANT!! SET ABSPATH variable in "compile" script file equals to the ABSOLUTE PATH to the directory of the project2

CONTENT OF THE PROJECT

def -> folder that contains default stuff (the base example)

build -> where the all the stuff is compiled. Every time you run compile script this folder is destroyed and rebuilt.

src -> where source (verilog and c) files are stored. For this project probably only files contained in src/mor1kx* will be modified 

file_list.scr -> file that tells iverilog where to find source files.
